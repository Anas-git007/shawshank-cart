# ðŸ›’ Online Shopping Cart - OOP Project  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project is an **Online Shopping Cart** application developed using **Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles**. It provides a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for users to browse products, add them to a virtual cart, manage their selections, and complete the checkout process. The application also features **user authentication** and **shopping history tracking**.  

## ðŸš€ Features  
âœ” **User Authentication** â€“ Login and signup functionality.  
âœ” **Product Catalog** â€“ Browse products with images, prices, and availability.  
âœ” **Shopping Cart** â€“ Add, remove, and adjust item quantities dynamically.  
âœ” **Checkout Process** â€“ View total cost and confirm purchases.  
âœ” **Order History** â€“ Track past orders for future reference.  
âœ” **Interactive GUI** â€“ A user-friendly interface with intuitive controls.  

## ðŸ”— Object-Oriented Design  
The project follows modular OOP principles with **six interlinked user-defined classes**:  
1. **Start Class** â€“ Manages user authentication and application startup.  
2. **User Class** â€“ Handles user data storage and retrieval.  
3. **Product Class** â€“ Displays product details and stock availability.  
4. **Cart Class** â€“ Manages items, calculates total cost, and stores history.  
5. **Checkout Class** â€“ Finalizes the shopping session and provides history access.  
6. **Person Class (Abstract)** â€“ Implements abstract methods for inheritance.  

## ðŸ’¡ Technologies Used  
ðŸ”¹ **Python** â€“ Core programming language  
ðŸ”¹ **Tkinter** â€“ GUI development  
ðŸ”¹ **OOP Principles** â€“ Inheritance, Association, Method Overriding, Operator Overloading, Abstract Classes, and Exception Handling  
ðŸ”¹ **File Handling** â€“ Storing user data and cart history  

## ðŸ”¥ Challenges Faced  
- Implementing a **dynamic and interactive GUI** for seamless shopping.  
- Managing **labels and increment buttons** for multiple products.  
- Ensuring **efficient integration** between GUI and backend logic.  

## ðŸ“ˆ Future Enhancements  
ðŸ”¸ **Product Categories** â€“ Organizing products for better navigation.  
ðŸ”¸ **Search & Filters** â€“ Allowing users to find products quickly.  
ðŸ”¸ **Wishlist Feature** â€“ Letting users save products for future purchase.  
ðŸ”¸ **Discount Codes** â€“ Implementing promo codes at checkout.
